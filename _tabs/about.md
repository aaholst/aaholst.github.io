*Hi! I am a Danish sociologist studying my M.Sc. in Sociology at University of Copenhagen.*

# Academic Interest
My interests revolve around digital behaviour, online communities, power and politics, the interconnection between the digital and the analogue spheres, and social theory.

# Work
Currently, I am working as a student assistent at *Department of Political Science, University of Copenhagen*, designing, conducting, and analysing a conjoint experiment on the affect of different aspects of working environment of the Danish parliament on members of youth political organisations preference for seeking election. The project is done with prof. Lene Holm Pedersen and ass. prof. Karina Kosiara-Pedersen.

Previously, I have worked as a student analyst and partner at the Danish consultancy firm *Analysis & Numbers* working with big data, surveys, and democratic fora to enable civil society actors with better knowledge about both the hostile and deliberate qualities of the public debate.

# Education
I hold a Bachelor of Science in Sociology from University of Copenhagen (2021-2024). Thematically, I have researched everything from ethnic integration in small villages to incel culture and the relationship between corruption and trust in political institutions. Using social network analysis, I mapped the Danish financial sector for the first time in my thesis.

I am currently studying my Master of Science in Sociology also at University of Copenhagen (2024-2026 (expected)). Specialising in political sociology, I have researched insitutional power on Discord fora and bureaucratic (and problematic) implementation of body-worn cameras in the Danish police.

In 2023, I also studied at the University of California, Berkeley. During my exchange I studied American politics and enjoyed new friends in my dorm. In 2025, I will enroll at Lund University in Sweden to study sociology of law and human geography.
